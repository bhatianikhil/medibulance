        <br/>-Should you be the first on scene at an accident:
        Your own safety must be priority when approaching the scene of an accident. Make sure that all traffic has stopped and that people have been alerted that there has been an accident to prevent additional casualties.
        If other people are around get them to phone the emergency services however if you are on your own, first assess the situation and treat any life-threatening conditions first and then call for an ambulance.
        <br/>-If anyone is not moving:
        Ascertain whether they’re responsive or not. If there is no response, check if they are breathing.
        *Unresponsive and breathing:
        Ensure they are in a position where they are leaning forward or to one side to ensure the airway remains open. Move them as little as possible and avoid twisting them.<br/>
        Keep them warm.<br/>
        *Unresponsive and not breathing:<br/>
        If the person is not breathing you will need to resuscitate them. If you are on your own and haven’t called an ambulance yet, you must do so at this point.<br/>
        If necessary, ask their advice on the best way to resuscitate as it’s not easy to do if they are in a car.<br/>
